# About BreakTime
This Microsoft PowerApp is a cool utility that allows you to quickly configure an informational screen to display on screen during a meeting break.  The tool can be used for in person or online events as it only requires a browser.  

On Launch you can configure what the tool will display when you run it as follows:

# Video / Picture Settings
The application has a Microsoft Stream Video control to be used with your companies O365 Stream service.  You can add any valid Stream URL and it will play automatically when you press run.  You can also point it to any valid Stream channel.  If you use a Stream Channel you will have to select which video to play once you press run.

If you would like to just display your own static picture, choose picture on the radio button.  When you press run you can then upload the picture you would like to display on the run screen.  Press the 'change picture' in the lower right hand corner once you run.

# Survey URL
There is an optional place to display a survey URL.  What ever URL you type in this box will be displayed along with a QR code for it when you press run.  It does not have to be a survey, it can actually be any URL you like and you can customize the text that describes it.

# Timer
